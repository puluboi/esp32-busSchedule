# esp32-busSchedule

A very simple ESP32 application that pulls stop data from HSL Reititys-API and displays it.
Could very easily be made more flexible, atm very strictly made for my nearest stop.

HSL API: https://www.hsl.fi/hsl/avoin-data

WHERE TO FIND STOP_ID: https://digitransit.fi/en/developers/apis/1-routing-api/stops/
